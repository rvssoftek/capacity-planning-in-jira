# Capacity Planning in Jira

## Introduction
Capacity planning, in the context of software development, refers to the process of determining the resources required to meet project demands efficiently. It involves analyzing the current capacity, identifying future capacity requirements, and making predictions to ensure optimal resource allocation. This proactive planning enables organizations to effectively cope with increased workload and deliver projects on time.

## When is Capacity Planning even required?
Capacity planning is useful and required any time you’re trying to ensure that your supply meets demand. This means whether it's a week, month, quarter, year, or more, capacity planning is always a good idea and rule of thumb to stick to. 

For many businesses, leaders and managers have a lot to handle. Among some of their responsibilities are:

- Keeping track of autonomous teams
- Being aware of changing priorities
- Preparing for unpredictable tasks
- Matrix structures
- Handling remote workers
- The space between actual work and planned work (i.e., the reality of the situation)

With so many moving parts, it doesn’t make sense to go forward without a plan. Having a capacity planning strategy is a great way to get ahead of the challenges that are sure to arise.

Capacity planning is a great way to invest your time because it helps you address possible future issues, take advantage of the benefits that come with planning, improve team performance, and streamline your business tasks for increased efficiency.

## How Does Capacity Planning Help in Sprint Planning?
To keep things organized, many companies practice Sprint Planning. Sprint planning refers to organizing and assigning all tasks to the right team members in a certain period of time.

In many cases, sprint planning is dependent on each team member doing their part. This means that once a task is done, another team member can start their task, and so on. If one team member falls behind, it could derail the process to some degree, but this is where capacity planning comes in.

With capacity planning, sprint planning is made tighter, more efficient, and achievable. When you prepare for possibilities like missed deadlines, not having enough workers or product, or even bottlenecks in the supply chain, you’re better equipped to handle such issues should they come up.

In a way, capacity is like having a Plan A and a Plan B in one: you have your main course of action as well as several contingency plans should anything go wrong, become delayed, or need extra attention.

## Capacity Planning Benefits
